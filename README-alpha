A new pretest for the `recode' program and library is now available as:

   http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/recode/recode-3.5a.tar.gz

This is beta status software.  You are invited to use the mailing list
mailto:recode-forum@iro.umontreal.ca, but you could also write to me either
at mailto:recode-bugs@iro.umontreal.ca or mailto:pinard@iro.umontreal.ca.

Most pretesters may skip this pretest, which is more a snapshot to help
communication with some collaborators on specific matters.  There will
be other pretests before 3.6 goes out.  A few reported bugs related to
portability have been addressed.  In this snapshot, many matters are still
pending.  I usually send a letter to a submitter once his/her report has
been acted upon, you know if I replied to yours! :-)

This pretest contains many changes in the installation engineering, first
by using newer Autoconf, Automake, Libtool, Help2man, and such things,
but also by using an experimental Makefile scheme for `gettext' matters.
A few internal Perl or awk scripts have been rewritten into Python.

Bugs have been corrected, and especially the following ones:
- HTML with `-d' was spuriously repeating part of the input into the output.
- Base64 decoding was uselessly requiring `-f' to complete, in many cases.
- The validation suite should now work in DJGPP/DOSWIN environments.
