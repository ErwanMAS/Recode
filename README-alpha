A new pretest for the `recode' program and library is now available as:

   http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/recode/recode-3.5d.tar.gz

This pretest release is a snapshot to help testing `libiconv' matters.
Many matters are pending yet, to my knowledge, none is critical.  I might
process a few more, not much, with the goal of freezing features at the
next pretest, and then prepare a real release if all goes well enough.

Use mailto:recode-bugs@iro.umontreal.ca to report problems, or
mailto:recode-forum@iro.umontreal.ca for a discussion mailing list.
You need to subscribe first, see the `README' file to find how.
