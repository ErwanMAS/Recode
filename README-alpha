A new pretest for the `recode' program and library is now available as:

   http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/recode/recode-3.5c.tar.gz

This is beta status software.  You are invited to use the mailing list
mailto:recode-forum@iro.umontreal.ca, but you could also write to me either
at mailto:recode-bugs@iro.umontreal.ca or mailto:pinard@iro.umontreal.ca.

The `libiconv' library, from Bruno Haible, has been integrated within
`recode', it is not necessary to pre-install it anymore.  Please read the
`libiconv' node in the Texinfo manual before testing.
